main.py: The main script to preprocess data, build, train, and evaluate the neural network model.

README.md: Documentation for the project.

.gitignore: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.

Data Science and Analytics Workflow
Data Loading and Exploration:

The MNIST dataset is loaded and explored to understand the distribution of handwritten digits.

Visualizations are created to examine sample images and pixel intensity distributions.

Data Preprocessing:

Data normalization is applied to scale pixel values.

Data augmentation techniques (rotation, zoom, shift) are used to enhance the training dataset.

Model Building:

A neural network model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, with layers for flattening, dense connections, and dropout for regularization.

Model Training:

The model is trained on the augmented dataset using the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss.

Model Evaluation:

The model's performance is evaluated on the test dataset using accuracy and loss metrics.

Results are analyzed to determine model effectiveness and areas for improvement.

Results
Accuracy: Achieved 97.55% accuracy on the test dataset.

Loss: Final loss value of 0.073 indicates the model's robustness and reliability.
